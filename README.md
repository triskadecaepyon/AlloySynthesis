# AlloySynthesis
An Alloy framework example that provides synthesis capabilities to mechanical and software designs.

This project was created for the Master's Report, available at [here](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/34587/LIU-MASTERSREPORT-2015.pdf) or at UT Austin's main library page [here](http://catalog.lib.utexas.edu/search~S29?/X(mechanical+synthesis)&searchscope=29&SORT=D/X(mechanical+synthesis)&searchscope=29&SORT=D&SUBKEY=(mechanical+synthesis)/1%2C498%2C498%2CB/frameset&FF=X(mechanical+synthesis)&searchscope=29&SORT=D&1%2C1%2C).

Future developments will focus on the development of the frameworks and formal proofs to assist in synthesis.
